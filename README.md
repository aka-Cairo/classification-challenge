# Spam Classification Model Comparison

This project compares the performance of two machine learning models, Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier, for predicting spam emails based on a given dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains features extracted from emails, with a binary target variable indicating whether an email is spam (1) or not spam (0).

## Models Evaluated

### Logistic Regression
- **Model Type**: Supervised learning, linear model.
- **Key Features**: Assumes linear relationship between features and target.
- **Strengths**: Simple, interpretable, and efficient for linearly separable data.
- **Limitations**: Limited ability to capture complex non-linear relationships in data.

### Random Forest Classifier
- **Model Type**: Ensemble learning method using decision trees.
- **Key Features**: Captures non-linear relationships, reduces overfitting, handles feature interactions well.
- **Strengths**: Robust performance for complex datasets, good generalization.
- **Limitations**: More complex, may require more computational resources.

## Prediction and Justification

I predicted that the Random Forest Classifier would perform better than Logistic Regression on this dataset due to its ability to handle complex relationships and interactions between features, which are common in spam classification tasks.

### Justification
- Random Forests excel in capturing non-linear patterns and feature interactions, which are prevalent in email spam detection.
- Logistic Regression, while effective for simpler relationships, may struggle with the intricacies present in this dataset.

## Conclusion

Both models were trained and evaluated on the dataset, achieving identical accuracy scores of 0.9197. This outcome underscores the importance of considering additional metrics and model characteristics beyond accuracy alone for a comprehensive evaluation.

### Next Steps

Further analysis could involve:
- Exploring additional metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) to assess model performance comprehensively.
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters to potentially improve model performance.
- Investigating feature importance to understand which features contribute most to predicting spam emails.
